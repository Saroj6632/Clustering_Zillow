# Zillow Clustering Project
## Goals
The project aims to improve original estimate of the log error by using clustering methodologies.

## Project Description
Zillow data for single family property with the transaction date in the year of 2017 will be analyzed and clustering methodologies will be used to predict the log error and various regression model will be built based upon the best features. And finally, I would give some recommendations, next steps to take.

## Deliverables
- Github repository
  1. README file
  2. Final notebook
  3. .py modules with all functions to reproduce the model

## Initial Questions
  1. Does county(location) is related to the logerror?
  2. Is there  any relation between log error and house price, yearbuilt?
  3. Is there any relation between log error  bead and bath ratio?
  4. Why Orange county have high log error?
